# Hello there, I’m David Chuka 👋🏿

### What I actually do:

I’m a **Technical Educator & DevRel Lead** who spent the last few years as the Director of Technical Content at Vue Mastery. 
I translate complex technologies like AI-native workflows, SSR engines, and state management into high-production content that developers actually enjoy consuming.

_In summary, I speak fluent "Developer"_

### Quick Stats

- 🎓 **Reach:** My courses and articles have reached **200k+ developers** globally.

### things I believe in:
1. **Documentation is a love letter** to your future self (or a very angry teammate).
2. If you can't explain it in a 2-minute video, you probably don't understand it yet.
3. Coding is evolving, but how we learn is changing even faster. In an AI-driven world, my mission is to move past 'copy-paste' tutorials and focus on teaching developers how to think and architect.
